Summary: More birds

A very nice place for birding near my home is Orrmond Beach.  They have a facebook page at <https://www.facebook.com/friendsoformondbeach>
There are two places to walk.  One is straight down to the beach and the other is along the Edison Canal.  There are many species at this reserve, but I only saw a few on this outing.  
And I am so new at this hobby that I emjoy seeing common species as much as an experienced 700 birder enjoys a new sighting.
