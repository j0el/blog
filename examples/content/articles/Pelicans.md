Summary: Some pelicans near my home

One of the guys that helps with water collection is an avid birdwatcher so when I started getting interested in photography and birds it was natural to ask him for advice.  He took me to [Ventura Wildlife Refuge](https://footpathing.com/ventura-bird-refuge) which has many species.  Herons, Egrets, Ducks, Geese, Sparrows, Blackbirds, and many more.  But since I am building this website using Pelican, I decided to start with a gallery of some Pelican shots.

You can find hundreds of California Brown Pelicans here.  Actually the best place is to park in the lot by Surfers Knoll and walk on the beach.  The Pelicans fly over the ocean and back to one of the ponds in the refuge.
