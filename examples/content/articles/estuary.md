Summary: Some birds


I went walking by the Santa Clara Estuary this morning and saw a few interesting birds, the rarest being the red phalarope. ![]({photo}estuary/_R0A9811.jpg)

It was a bit overcast so I did not get the best lighting.  I also saw a few dead pelicans and I had heard a news story that this is a problem.
Anyway, enjoy.
