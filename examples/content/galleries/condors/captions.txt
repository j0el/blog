_ROA1232.jpg: This is the flightpen where they breed, capture, doctor, study condors.
_ROA1245.jpg: There were 5 rooms like this in the back of the flightpen where they can keep the condors and hatch the eggs.
_ROA1247.jpg: This is more of the flightpen.  They can control the openings to capture or release birds.
