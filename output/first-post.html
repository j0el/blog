</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Well, after being retired for about 7 years I finally have enough time to start crossing off bucket list items.  This one is a double header.  I wanted to tell my story so my grand kids and maybe great grand kids would know a bit about their heritage, and I wanted to take up a hobby.  So my new hobby is photography.  I never have done much in the creative world and photography seems to be a great way to get creative.  My focus is to be birds in flight, but I have to learn a lot before I get good at that.  I think I will alternate posts with some of my images and with some of my life&nbsp;story.</p>
<p><strong>I was born in Boston</strong> on January 9, 1947 to Esther and Frank Berman, the children of immigrants from what is now Ukraine.  My dad had come back from <span class="caps">WWII</span> in 1946, got married to his longtime sweetheart, and a year later I was born.  My dad was from Boston and my mom was from Quincy, the city of Presidents, just South of Boston.  I wound up in the <span class="caps">NAVY</span> in 1967.  I was supposed to be a musician, but during boot camp, while playing in Chicago in a cold wet January I got pneumonia and the <span class="caps">NAVY</span> decided they and I would be better off if they sent me off to learn about computers.  It was a good change for me.  I knew nothing about computers, but no one else knew much either.  Here is an interesting article about what I was supposed to be doing. <a href="https://ethw.org/First-Hand:No_Damned_Computer_is_Going_to_Tell_Me_What_to_DO_-_The_Story_of_the_Naval_Tactical_Data_System,_NTDS"><span class="caps">NAVY</span> <span class="caps">NTDS</span></a>. Unfortunately my Dad was in a very bad car accident and the <span class="caps">NAVY</span> nicely transferred me to Washington D.C&gt; so I could be closer to my&nbsp;family.  </p>
<p><strong>Joined the <span class="caps">NAVY</span> to see the world.</strong> I was stationed in North Chicago, not to be confused with the North part of Chicago, then Mare Island in Vallejo California, then Washington D.C., then Norfolk Virginia where I met my wonderful wife and when I was finally discharged in 1972, we moved back to Massachusetts.  This time we lived in Boxboro and I went to work for Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard <span class="caps">MA</span>. </p>
<p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation"><span class="caps">DEC</span></a> I started as a WorldWide support engineer and traveled all over the world, many more places than I ever saw in the <span class="caps">NAVY</span>. Our son Art was born in 1974, and then David in 1977 and we moved to Shirley, <span class="caps">MA</span>., then to Groton <span class="caps">MA</span>.  In 1990 we moved to Hong Kong which interesting and fun and came back to Groton in 2000.  35 years after starting at <span class="caps">DEC</span> I got an incredible early retirement offer so I retired.  It wasn&#8217;t <span class="caps">DEC</span> anymore anyway, <span class="caps">DEC</span> was bought by <span class="caps">COMPAQ</span> which in turn was bought by <span class="caps">HP</span> so I have an <span class="caps">HP</span> gold badge.  After two weeks of retirement I was bored out of my mind and was lucky enough to get a job at Red Hat, a pioneer in commercial open source software, especially Linux.  <figure class="video_container">
 
<div align="center"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YF_I_zACgL4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
I had a great 7 years there winding up a <span class="caps">VP</span> of marketing, but got restructured out of a job.  Another company after that, then a few years consulting on my own (Wish I had started that many years earlier), a bout with cancer, some open heart surgery to correct a congenital deformity, kids got married, had grandchildren, wife had some medical issues, and now Fran and I are happily settled in Oxnard California where the weather and the view is perfect and the Mexican food and Seafood is to die for.  And I finally have the time to play - hence this blog.

I am on the technology committee for my <span class="caps">HOA</span> where we are working on access control and video surveillance, am on the Channel Islands Neighborhood Council where I am mostly interested in water quality in our harbor, and as I mentioned, I have taken up photography and will post some of my pictures soon.  I didn&#8217;t write about my (lack of) education or work history on purpose because I googled myself and found thousands of entries about other Joel Bermans and only a few about me so I am rather insignificant it&nbsp;seems.
